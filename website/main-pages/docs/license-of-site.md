## What is not licensed?
We say "nearly everything" as there are a few simple conditions that apply.

Google's trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license. Please see our standard guidelines for third party use of Google brand features for information about this usage.

In some cases, a page may include content consisting of images, audio or video material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.

## Attribution
Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be found in section 4 of the Creative Commons legal code.

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to Google to the best of the ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.

There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

### Exact Reproductions
If your online work exactly reproduces text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.
Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information.

### Modified Versions
If your online work shows modified text or images based on the content from this site, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.
Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has been modified.

### Other Media
If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.
