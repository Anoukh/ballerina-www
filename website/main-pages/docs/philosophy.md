                    <p>Ballerina’s language semantics model how independent parties communicate via structured interactions. Subsequently, every Ballerina program can be displayed as a sequence diagram of its flow. </p>

                    <p>Ballerina represents clients, workers, and remote systems as different actors in the sequence diagram. In code, remote endpoints are interfaced via connectors, which offer type-safe actions. Graphically, each connector is represented as an actor in the sequence diagram (i.e., a vertical line) and actions are represented as interactions with those actors.</p>

                    <p>Ballerina’s execution model is composed of lightweight parallel execution units known as workers. Workers use non-blocking policies to ensure no function locks an executing thread, such as an HTTP I/O call awaiting response.</p>

                    <h3>TYPE SAFETY</h3>
                    <p>Ballerina has a structural type system with primitive, record, object, tuple, and union types. This type-safe model incorporates type inference at assignment and provides numerous compile time integrity checks for connectors, logic, and network-bound payloads.  </p>

                    <h3>UNION TYPES AND EXPLICIT NULLS</h3>
                    <p>Individual network endpoints often return messages with different payload types and errors, depending on their inputs and logic. Ballerina’s type system embraces this variability with an approach based on union types. Union types explicitly capture this semantics without requiring developers to create unnecessary “wrapper” types. This approach also enhances the handling of null values. By default, types do not support null values. Developers must explicitly create union types to handle nulls. The result is that null exceptions cannot happen and the language syntax and compiler identifies whether null handling logic is required or not.</p>

                    <h3>HETEROGENEOUS DATA HANDLING</h3>
                    <p>The Ballerina type system has rich built in support for JSON, XML, streams and tables, as well as direct support for ProtoBuf and gRPC. The result is clean, readable code for dealing with network payloads, SQL programming and stream processing. Data transformation logic isn’t encumbered with complex generated types, third-party library code or other obfuscation - simple clear readable code captures interactions with heterogenous data and transformation logic.</p>

                        Ballerina makes it easy to call functions and remote services asynchronously, wait for results when needed, check status and cancel asynchronous execution, fork and join threads, and pass data between threads.

                        Asynchronous calls to functions and endpoints create a future&lt;type&gt; variable that can then be passed further to other calls is needed. Once the actual value is needed, the wait operator can be used to wait for the actual return.

                        Functions can split their execution into multiple worker threads. Threads execute asynchronously but can exchange data and wait for data from other threads. Threads can join using different conditions (all end, some end).

                        To make developers more productive, var shorthand can be used instead of providing complex type signatures. In that case, Ballerina compiler will still infer the type best on the assignment statement and perform the corresponding consistency checks in the subsequent code.

                    <p>Ballerina is a language designed to be <em>integration simple</em>. Based around the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and connectors, including distributed transactions,
                        compensation and circuit breakers. With first-class support for JSON and XML, Ballerina makes it simple and effective to build robust integration across network endpoints.</p>

                        Ballerina compiler is extensible with packages. This particular example is using the Kubernetes package to generate Kubernetes artifacts and docker image. Other platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Mesos, and so on can have their own packages, annotations, and artifact generation.
