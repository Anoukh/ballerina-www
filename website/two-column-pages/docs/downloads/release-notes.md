##Concerns

Release policy - Do we need one? Go have one that details the number of releases supported. This is what Go has:

Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases. For example, Go 1.8 is supported until Go 1.10 is released, and Go 1.9 is supported until Go 1.11 is released. We fix critical problems, including critical security problems, in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions (for example, Go 1.9.1, Go 1.9.2, and so on).
