## Obtaining the Source Code and Building the Project

### Build Prerequisites

1. **Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8**

​Building Ballerina requires a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 8 to be installed. You can download one from

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 

[http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html) 

Note : Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.

1. **Install Maven 3.3+ or later **

Install maven 3.3+ or later version. [https://maven.apache.org/install.html](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

Set the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable to avoid the Maven OutOfMemoryError.

MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2048M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m" 

Make sure you have an active Internet connection to download dependencies while building.

2. **Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)**

3. **Docker **

### Building from the source

Clone this repository using the following command.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerinalang/ballerina


If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.

git submodule update --init 

Run the Maven command mvn clean install from the **ballerina root directory**:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mvn clean install</td>
    <td>Build and install the artifacts into the local repository.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true</td>
    <td>Build and install the artifacts into the local repository, without running any of the unit tests.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Extract the Ballerina distribution created at distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip.

## Setting up your development environment

### Setup IntelliJ IDEA

#### Importing a Ballerina Project

Import Any Ballerina Project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other maven project. 

* Navigate to Import Project

* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root pom.xml

* In "Import Project from Maven" Wizard, set followings.

    * Set "Import Maven Projects Automatically" .

    * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8

Optionally You can following maven command to build idea project.

	mvn idea:idea

([http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-idea-plugin/](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-idea-plugin/))

#### Useful IDEA Plugins

* ANTLR 4 - [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4-grammar-plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4-grammar-plugin) 

* Ballerina - [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina) (Need IDEA 2016.3 or newer)

### Setup Eclipse

#### Importing a Ballerina Project

All Ballerina repositories are developed as maven projects. So you can import any Ballerina project to eclipse similar to any maven project. 

* Navigate to File → Import..

* Select "Existing Maven Projects" under “Maven”

* Upon next, browse the file system, and open the maven module.

#### Installing ANTLR4 plugin

If you are working with the grammar, it would be useful to have [ANTLR 4 IDE](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/antlr-4-ide) plugin installed for eclipse. To install this using eclipse marketplace:

* Navigate to, Help → Eclipse Marketplace

* Search for "antlr4"

* Install ANTLR 4 IDE plugin (which supports antlr 4.x version).

To open the plugin views, navigate to:

* Window → Show View → Other.. 

* Under "ANTLR4" section, select and enable “Parse Tree” view and “Syntax Diagram” views.

## Working With Ballerina Grammar. 

Ballerina grammar has been implemented using [ANTLR4](http://www.antlr.org/). It is recommended to have some basic understanding on anltr4 grammar syntax and concepts, before working with the Ballerina grammar. "Parr, Terence (January 15, 2013), The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference" is a good reference to get started with.

Ballerina grammar can be found under [docs/grammar](https://github.com/ballerinalang/ballerina/tree/master/docs/grammar) in the Ballerina repository. It consists of two files:

* BallerinaLexer.g4 - Contains the lexer rules for Ballerina grammar. Lexer is responsible for tokenizing an input Ballerina source code.

* BallerinaParser.g4 - Contains the parser rules. Parser listens to the token stream generated by the lexer. High level grammar productions/abstractions are defined in the parser using those tokens.

**Tips**

* If you want to check and validate a grammar rule you just wrote, you can use the antlr4 plugin of your IDE. See [Setting up your development environment](#heading=h.gxu13uvhedxr)** **section for more details.

### Generating parsers

Once a change is done to the any of the grammar files, it is needed to re-generate the parsers. To generate parsers, we first need to download [antlr-complete-4.5.3.jar](http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar). Then navigate to <ballerina>/docs/grammar, and generate the lexer followed by the parser (order is important) using the following command:

java -jar /home/supun/Downloads/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar *.g4 -package org.wso2.ballerinalang.compiler.parser.antlr4 -o ../../compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/.

Above command will auto generate some java classes. Out of the auto generated classes, [BallerinaParserBaseListener.java](https://github.com/ballerinalang/ballerina/blob/master/modules/ballerina-lang/src/main/java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/BallerinaParserBaseListener.java) in particular is important, as the Ballerina AST builder is written on top of it. Thus, If any new rules are added to the BallerinaParser.g4, above command will generate new methods in the BallerinaParserBaseListener.java, and you need to override those newly added methods inside [BLangParserListener.java](https://github.com/ballerinalang/ballerina/blob/master/modules/ballerina-lang/src/main/java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/BLangParserListener.java) accordingly.

# Proposing Changes To Ballerina

Start with the discussion in the [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev).

Once there is enough consensus around the proposal, you will likely be asked to file an **Issue** in GitHub and label it as **Proposal**, to continue the discussion on details there.
