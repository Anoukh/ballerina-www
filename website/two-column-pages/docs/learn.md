# Learn Ballerina

[Ballerina](http://ballerina.io) is a general purpose, concurrent and strongly typed programming language with both textual and graphical syntaxes, optimized for integration. It is designed to make it easier to write programs that integrate with data sources, services, and network-connected APIs of all kinds. 

Although Ballerina is optimized primarily for such programs, it can be used to program anything. However, it is recommended to use Ballerina if a significant portion of the program is related to integrating with data sources, services, or network-connected APIs.

## Getting Started

The Getting Started section includes instructions on how to download Ballerina and install the tools that come along with it. This also includes system requirements, details on how to test your installation, and instructions on how to uninstall Ballerina.

## Quick Tour

The [Quick Tour](https://github.com/ballerina-lang/ballerina/blob/master/docs/quick-tour.md) gives you instructions on how to start Ballerina, run a simple code, and get a response within seconds. It also introduces the means to quickly get started and take Ballerina for its first spin.

## Ballerina by Example

[Ballerina by Example](https://ballerinalang.org/docs/by-example/) is one of the easiest ways to learn Ballerina. This consists of a series of example programs that provide annotations alongside the code for guidance on how to use the example.

## Ballerina by Guide

Ballerina by Guide is a series of long form examples that showcase a complete lifecycle of development with Ballerina including setting up the environment, using tools, build system, authoring code, running tests, and deploying within an architecture environment. Guides illustrate collaboration across multiple Ballerina Platform components, such as the language and the API gateway for example. Each guide exists in a separate repository of its own in a dedicated organization.

## How to Structure Ballerina Code

The How to Structure Ballerina Code topic expands on the structure of programs, directories, packages, and repositories.

## Editors, IDEs and the Ballerina Composer

[Editors, IDEs and the Ballerina Composer](https://github.com/ballerina-lang/ballerina/blob/master/docs/tools-ides-ballerina-composer.md) is a topic that introduces you to several tools that can help create, document, and test your code. These tools can be various editors, IDEs, and a graphical visualization tool for your code called the Ballerina Composer.
