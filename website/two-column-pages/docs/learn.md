# Learn Ballerina

Ballerina is a general purpose, concurrent and strongly typed programming language with both textual and graphical syntaxes, optimized for integration. It is designed to make it easier to write programs that integrate with data sources, services, and network-connected APIs of all kinds. 

Although Ballerina is optimized primarily for such programs, it can be used to program anything. However, it is recommended to use Ballerina if a significant portion of the program is related to integrating with data sources, services, or network-connected APIs.

## Getting Started

The Getting Started section includes instructions on how to download Ballerina and install the tools that come along with it. This also includes system requirements, details on how to test your installation, and instructions on how to uninstall Ballerina.

## Quick Tour

The [Quick Tour](/learn/quick-tour/) gives you instructions on how to start Ballerina, run a simple code, and get a response within seconds. It also introduces the means to quickly get started and take Ballerina for its first spin.

## Ballerina by Example

[Ballerina by Example](/learn/by-example/) enables you to have complete coverage over the language, while emphasizing incremental learning. This is a series of commented example programs.

## Ballerina by Guide

Ballerina by Guide is a series of long form examples that showcase a complete lifecycle of integration development with Ballerina including setting up the environment, using tools, build system, authoring code, running tests, and deploying in an integration environment. Guides illustrate how different language components work together, such as the language and the API gateway for example. 

## How to Structure Ballerina Code

The How to Structure Ballerina Code topic expands on the structure of programs, directories, packages, and repositories.

## Editors, IDEs and the Ballerina Composer

[Editors, IDEs and the Ballerina Composer](https://github.com/ballerina-lang/ballerina/blob/master/docs/tools-ides-ballerina-composer.md) is a topic that introduces you to several tools that can help create, document, and test your code. These tools can be various editors, IDEs, and a graphical visualization tool for your code called the Ballerina Composer.
