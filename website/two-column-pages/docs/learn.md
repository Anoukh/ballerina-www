# Learn Ballerina

Ballerina is a general purpose, concurrent and strongly typed programming language with both textual and graphical syntaxes, optimized for integration. It is designed to make it easier to write programs that integrate with data sources, services, and network-connected APIs of all kinds.

Although Ballerina is optimized primarily for such programs, it can be used to program anything. However, it is recommended to use Ballerina if a significant portion of the program is related to integrating with data sources, services, or network-connected APIs.

## Getting Started

The Getting Started section includes instructions on how to download Ballerina and install the tools that come along with it. This also includes system requirements, details on how to test your installation, and instructions on how to uninstall Ballerina.
