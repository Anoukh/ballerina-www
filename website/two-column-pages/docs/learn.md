# Learn Ballerina

Ballerina is a simple programming language whose syntax and runtime address the hard problems of integration and is designed to be integration simple. Ballerina's syntax, code, and compiler create runtime services and deployment artifacts that are cloud native ready for deployment within your IaaS, orchestrator, or service mesh of choice.

Based around the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and connectors, including distributed transactions, compensation, and circuit breakers.
